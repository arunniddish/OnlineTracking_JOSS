# Summary

MarkerVision is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that enables vision-based pose estimation of robots using inexpensive webcams and colored fiducial markers. It provides an accessible, low-cost solution for tracking the position and orientation of mobile or articulated robots without requiring specialized motion capture systems. The toolbox offers modular functions for camera calibration, color-based marker segmentation, and 2D/3D pose computation, making it suitable for experimental robotics, education, and reproducible research workflows.

# Statement of need

Precise pose estimation is essential for evaluating robot locomotion, control algorithms, and interaction with the environment. Commercial tracking systems (e.g., Vicon, OptiTrack) are often prohibitively expensive, limiting accessibility for many research labs and educational institutions. Existing open-source alternatives can require complex setup or specialized hardware. MarkerVision addresses this gap by providing a simple, MATLAB-based approach that only relies on commodity webcams and readily available colored markers, lowering the barrier for vision-based tracking in robotics research.

Localization in robotics refers to the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot to itself and the environment which is crucial in mobile robots for safe navigation, autonomous , finding locomotion modes (gait synthesis), path planning, obstacle avoidance. Commercially available technologies like VICON, Optitrack, Xsens, Qualisys, Motion Analysis Corporation, TrackLab uses IMUs, GPS, reflective markers with infrared cameras, or a combination of these which is very expensive and tedious to setup and extract useful information. Here we use a simple setup employed with vision based tracking using simple inexpensive web-cameras with colored markers pasted on the robot acting as robot’s fiducials for a 2D planar motion. With arithmetic operation using the pixel data of the markers here we can find the se2 of the robot for both body and global. Nearest neighbor method employed to maintain consistent indexing of the markers. In case of occlusion of markers due to tether or any other objects, the markers are reconstructed using algorithm to ensure no loss of data. Overall this package is efficient, cheap, easy to setup, no need to remove the markers after experiments for analyzing 2D planar motion. Suitable for in lab setup and the main cost is only for buying a webcam.
